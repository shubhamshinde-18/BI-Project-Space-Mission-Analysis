# BI-Project-Space-Mission-Analysis


Explored space mission data from 1957 to 2022 using Power BI, analyzing trends in mission success, investments, rocket types, and launch sites. Identified a total of 4,630 missions, with a 90% success rate. Investigated the top investing companies, the amount spent on missions, and the status of rockets as of August 2022.
Key insights include the most commonly used rocket types, major launch locations, and year-over-year trends in both the number of missions and investment.
This project was part of the Maven Analytics challenge, providing a data-driven understanding of space exploration history and funding.
